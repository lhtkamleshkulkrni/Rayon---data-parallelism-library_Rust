# Rayon---data-parallelism-library_Rust

- Rayon is a data-parallelism library for Rust. 
- It is extremely lightweight
- Data-parallelism library that makes it easy to convert sequential computations into parallel
- Makes it easy to convert a sequential computation into a parallel one.
- Rayon is a data-parallelism library for Rust. 
- Rayon makes it drop-dead simple to convert sequential iterators into parallel 
- Rayon is lightweight and convenient for introducing parallelism into existing code. It guarantees data-race free executions and takes advantage of parallelism when sensible, based on work-load at runtime.
- Rayon: parallelize some spots without a full or major rewrite.
